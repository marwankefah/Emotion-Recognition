Facial expression recognition system based on Improved Adaboost with Gabor Features
  - A neural Improved AdaBoost based facial expression recognition system with Gabor Features and 2-layer neural network
  - Supported Classes are Happy(0), Angry(1), Sad(2), Surprised (3), Neutral (4), Others (5).
  - Average recognition rates in JAFFE, and CK+ is 98% and 97% respectively.
  - The execution time for processing 100 Ã— 100 pixel size is 10 ms on CPU.
### Ada.py is an Improved Adaboost Algorithm to select best N features from Gabor Filters Bank that distinguish between Face (affectNet) / No Face (CIFAR-10) after balancing both datasets.  

# Run For a single Image
```
$ git clone https://github.com/marwankefah/emotionRecognition
```

```
$ python run.py --imgPath [path to image] --outPath [path to output]
```

## Example 1
```
$ python run.py --imgPath face.jpg --outPath result.jpg
```

![result](https://github.com/marwankefah/emotionRecognition/blob/master/result.jpg)
## Example 2
```
$ python run.py --imgPath surprised.jpg --outPath result1.jpg
```
